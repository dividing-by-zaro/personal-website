Hello world! This is another example blog post.

## Getting Started

You can create new posts by adding markdown files to the `src/posts` directory.

Each file should have:
- A filename in the format `YYYY-MM-DD-title-slug.md`
- Frontmatter with title, date, and preview
- Your markdown content below the frontmatter
