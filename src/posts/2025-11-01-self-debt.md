## What is it

Self-credit is a budgeting strategy for keeping spending low. If budgets feel restrictive, you can reframe them as a weekly allowance. You give yourself credit each week to spend on whatever you want, guilt-free.

## How it works

Self-credit has three rules.

1. Each Monday, you get $x in credit (e.g. $50) that can be used for any purchase.
2. If you spend more than your credit, you're now in self-debt. You can no longer make any purchases until your balance is positive again.
3. Credit does not roll over.

## Example

| Day | Action | Credit Balance |
|-----|--------|----------------|
| Week 1 Monday | Weekly $50 credit | $50 |
| Wednesday | Spend $27 on new books | $23 |
| Saturday | Spend $12 on OpenAI credits | $11 |
| Week 2 Monday | Weekly $50 credit | $50 |
| Tuesday | Spend $89 on fitness tracker | -$39 |
| Week 3 Monday | Weekly $50 credit | $11 |

## Tips

- Try not to go into debt. You'll feel the pain next week.
- You can have multiple lines of credit for different budgets, like one for eating out & one for durable goods.
- If you're in debt but want to buy something, put a picture of it on a dream board or wishlist. You can always get it next week.
- Try gradually lowering your limit over time.
